Beneath my feet, the cool brown soil,
A foundation for all human toil.
With oceans deep and skies so blue,
The Earth sustains, and makes us new. 
A fragile sphere in space, a home,
Where wind and rain and rivers roam.
From mountain high to valley low,
The seeds of life begin to grow. 
Oh, quiet earth, so vast and deep,
Our promises to you we keep.
To hold your breath, to shield your trees,
And guard your green, and calm your seas. 
Time is power and power is timeTime is power and power is time.
 I am a god
